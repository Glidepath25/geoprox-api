The AI engineer successfully developed the GeoProx mobile app from concept to near-production, implementing login, permit listing, and detailed site/sample inspection forms with features like photo uploads, Google Maps integration, and multi-select fields. A major architectural shift integrated the app with an AWS PostgreSQL backend and JWT authentication. The engineer navigated significant challenges: persistent network connectivity issues with the RDS database (requiring a new public instance and eventually hardcoding an IP), iterative debugging of authentication schemas (from  to PBKDF2), and resolving numerous frontend-backend schema mismatches for permit data display (desktop, site, sample details) and form submission. The process was marked by continuous user feedback, debugging of frontend caching, and correcting backend SQL queries (company_id filtering). The immediate work is stalled on fixing the payload structure for site/sample inspection form submission, as the frontend sends a nested  object while the backend expects a flatter structure.

<product_requirements>
The GeoProx mobile app aims to provide site inspection forms for field workers. It features user login, permit listing with search and status updates (Pending, WIP, Complete), and dedicated Permit Module and Sample Testing forms. Forms support Save Draft or Submit, photo attachments (camera/gallery), and location linking to Google Maps. Multi-select for surface locations was implemented. A key requirement is that any user within a company can update other users' permits. The core development focused on integrating with the user's production AWS PostgreSQL database, implementing JWT for mobile authentication, and planned integration with S3 for artifacts. Backend also added PDF generation upon submission. The application now supports login and viewing permit details, but the save/submit functionality for inspection forms requires further debugging.

<pending_tasks>
- Frontend integration for S3 storage for artifacts (e.g., photos attached to inspections), pending backend upload endpoint.
- Implement more robust token refresh logic (automatic refresh or on 401 errors) within .
- Address the user's critical environment/forking issue to ensure stable and consistent database access (current working database bypasses immediate issue).
- Fix the  payload structure mismatch in the frontend's save functions for site and sample inspections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing issues with saving and submitting data for both Site Inspection and Sample Testing forms. Despite numerous fixes, including updating frontend API endpoints to  and , and updating backend models (, ) to accept  and , the forms were not correctly persisting changes.

The backend's update queries were found to be incorrectly filtering by  instead of , which was fixed to allow all company members to update permits. A UI bug causing Green status indicators to display with Red formatting in the permits list was also fixed by aligning frontend rendering logic with backend string values.

The most recent investigation pinpointed the core problem for the save/submit functionality: a fundamental mismatch in the  payload structure sent by the frontend's  function in  and the  model expected by the backend. The frontend is currently sending a deeply nested payload where actual form fields are encapsulated within , whereas the backend expects these form fields to be directly present within the  object itself. This structural discrepancy is preventing the backend from correctly parsing and saving the submitted inspection and sample testing data, leading to the reported behavior where changes are not saved.
