The AI engineer successfully progressed the GeoProx mobile app from a basic concept to near-production, integrating with a live AWS PostgreSQL backend and JWT authentication. The work involved significant frontend and backend modifications to handle new data schemas, implement token management, and align mobile-specific features (like save draft) with existing desktop workflows. Challenges included debugging authentication (ATS,  on web,  resets), adapting to new production API endpoints and data structures, and resolving UI rendering errors due to schema mismatches. The engineer iteratively fixed issues, collaborated with user feedback, and is currently resolving a  after implementing load functionality for sample testing.

<product_requirements>
The GeoProx mobile app aims to provide site inspection forms for field workers, initially with login, permit listing, and basic inspection forms (with photos). Enhancements included displaying detailed permit info (risk assessment, status), search, save/submit options for inspections, a Permit Module screen, and a Sample Testing module. The core problem evolved to integrate with the user's production AWS PostgreSQL database, implement JWT for mobile authentication, and eventually link to S3 for artifacts. Recent requests focused on making location coordinates clickable to Google Maps, implementing multi-select for surface locations, consolidating sample testing save/submit to a single Save Changes button, and adding camera/gallery options for photo uploads. A key backend collaboration involved enabling PDF generation upon submission from mobile, and ensuring team members can update any company permit.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical  located in  at line 553. This error was reported by the user after refreshing both the web preview and the iOS Expo Go app, indicating a code breakage that prevents the application from loading. This specific error arose during the recent efforts to implement the functionality for loading saved data back into the sample testing form, following confirmation from the backend developer about the correct payload structure for . The current task is to debug and fix this syntax issue to restore the application's functionality.
